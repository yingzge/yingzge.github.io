[![import to Forestry](https://assets.forestry.io/import-to-forestryK.svg)](https://app.forestry.io/quick-start?repo=forestryio/kross-hugo-starter&engine=hugo&version=0.75.1)

This project has been pre-configured to work with [Forestry](https://forestry.io) a git-based CMS, [import your repository in Forestry](https://app.forestry.io/quick-start?repo=forestryio/kross-hugo-starter&engine=hugo&version=0.75.1) and you'll be able to edit and preview your site âœ¨. \

Any changes you make in Forestry will be commited back to the repo, and deployed when your Git repository is connected to [Netlify](#netlify).

## Deployment

### Netlify

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/forestryio/kross-hugo-starter)

1. Set the build command to: `hugo --gc --minify`
2. Set the publish directory to: `public`
3. Make sure to set `HUGO_VERSION` to 0.58.2 or above (tested with 0.75.1)
3. Set the publish directory to: `public`

That's it, now your site gets deployed automatically on `git push` or when saving documents from Forestry.

## Local development

This starter is using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) as a static site generator.
Once imported in Forestry, clone your repository and develop locally with Hugo.

```bash
# Clone your repository
# Go in the project directory
# Start local dev server
hugo server
```
